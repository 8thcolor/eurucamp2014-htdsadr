# Web hooks

Project web hooks allow you to trigger an URL if new code is pushed or a new issue is created.

---

You can configure web hooks to listen for specific events like pushes, issues or merge requests.
GitLab will send a POST request with data to the web hook URL.
Web hooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server.
If you send a web hook to an SSL endpoint [the certificate will not be verified](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/ccd617e58ea71c42b6b073e692447d0fe3c00be6/app/models/web_hook.rb#L35) since many people use self-signed certificates.

#### Example webhook receiver

If you want to see GitLab's webhooks in action for testing purposes you can use
a simple echo script running in a console session.

Save the following file as `print_http_body.rb`.

```ruby
require 'webrick'

server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(Port: ARGV.first)
server.mount_proc '/' do |req, res|
  puts req.body
end

trap 'INT' do server.shutdown end
server.start
```

Pick an unused port (e.g. 8000) and start the script: `ruby print_http_body.rb
8000`.  Then add your server as a webhook receiver in GitLab as
`http://my.host:8000/`.

When you press 'Test Hook' in GitLab, you should see something like this in the console.

```

```
