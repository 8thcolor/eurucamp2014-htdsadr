### Gitlab is open source software to collaborate on code

* Manage git repositories with fine grained access controls that keep your code secure
* Perform code reviews and enhance collaboration with merge requests
* Each project can also have an issue tracker and a wiki
* Used by more than 100,000 organizations, GitLab is the most popular solution to manage git repositories on-premises
* Completely free and open source (MIT Expat license)
* Powered by Ruby on Rails

### Canonical source

* The source of GitLab Communinity Edition is [hosted on GitLab Cloud](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/) and there are mirrors to make [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) as easy as possible.

* ruby 1.9.3+
* git 1.7.10+
* redis 2.0+
* MySQL or PostgreSQL

** More details are in the [requirements doc](doc/install/requirements.md)

### Installation

#### Official installation methods

* [GitLab packages](https://www.gitlab.com/downloads/) **recommended** These packages contain GitLab and all its depencies (Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Unicorn, etc.). They are made with [omnibus-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/README.md) that also contains the installation instructions.

* [GitLab Chef Cookbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cookbook-gitlab/blob/master/README.md) This cookbook can be used both for development installations and production installations. If you want to [contribute](CONTRIBUTE.md) to GitLab we suggest you follow the [development installation on a virtual machine with Vagrant](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cookbook-gitlab/blob/master/doc/development.md) instructions to install all testing dependencies.

* [Manual installation guide](doc/install/installation.md) This guide to set up a production server on Ubuntu offers detailed and complete step-by-step instructions.

#### Third party one-click installers

* [Digital Ocean 1-Click Application Install](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog_posts/host-your-git-repositories-in-55-seconds-with-gitlab) Have a new server up in 55 seconds. Digital Ocean uses SSD disks which is great for an IO intensive app such as GitLab. We recommend selecting a droplet with [1GB of memory](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/install/requirements.md).

* [BitNami one-click installers](http://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab) This package contains both GitLab and GitLab CI. It is available as installer, virtual machine or for cloud hosting providers (Amazon Web Services/Azure/etc.).

* [Cloud 66 deployment and management](http://blog.cloud66.com/installing-gitlab-ubuntu/) Use Cloud 66 to deploy GitLab to your own server or any cloud (eg. DigitalOcean, AWS, Rackspace, GCE) and then manage it with database backups, scaling and more.

#### Unofficial installation methods

* [GitLab recipes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/) repository with unofficial guides for using GitLab with different software (operating systems, webservers, etc.) than the official version.

* [Installation guides](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Unofficial-Installation-Guides) public wiki with unofficial guides to install GitLab on different operating systems.

### New versions and upgrading

Since 2011 GitLab is released on the 22nd of every month. Every new release includes an [upgrade guide](doc/update) and new features are detailed in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG).

It is recommended to follow a monthly upgrade schedule. Security releases come out when needed. For more information about the release process see the documentation for [monthly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/release/monthly.md) and [security](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/release/security.md) releases.

* Features that will be in the next releases are listed on the [feature request forum](http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general) with the status [started](http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general/status/796456) and [completed](http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general/status/796457).

### Run in production mode

The Installation guide contains instructions on how to download an init script and run it automatically on boot. You can also start the init script manually:

    sudo service gitlab start

or by directly calling the script

     sudo /etc/init.d/gitlab start

Please login with root / 5iveL!fe

### Run in development mode

Consider setting up the development environment with [the cookbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cookbook-gitlab/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Copy the example development unicorn configuration file

    cp config/unicorn.rb.example.development config/unicorn.rb

Start it with [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)

    bundle exec foreman start -p 3000

or start each component separately

    bundle exec rails s
    script/background_jobs start

And surf to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and login with root / 5iveL!fe

### Run the tests

* Run all tests

        bundle exec rake test

* [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) unit and functional tests

        All RSpec tests: bundle exec rake spec

        Single RSpec file: bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/commit_controller_spec.rb

* [Spinach](https://github.com/codegram/spinach) integration tests

        All Spinach tests: bundle exec rake spinach

        Single Spinach test: bundle exec spinach features/project/issues/milestones.feature
