### Installation

#### Official production installation

* [Installation guide for a production server](doc/install/installation.md)


#### Official development installation

If you want to contribute, please first read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then we suggest you to use the Vagrant virtual machine project to get an environment working with all dependencies.

* [Vagrant virtual machine for development](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-vagrant-vm)


#### Unofficial production installations

* [GitLab recipes](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-recipes) repository with unofficial guides for using GitLab with different software (operating systems, webservers, etc.) than the official version.

* [Installation guides](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Unofficial-Installation-Guides) public wiki with unofficial guides to install GitLab on different operating systems.


* [Digital Ocean 1-Click Application Install](https://www.digitalocean.com/) Have a new server up in 55 seconds. Digital Ocean uses SSD disks which is great for an IO intensive app as GitLab. Look for GitLab under 'Select Image' => 'Applications' when creating a droplet.

* [BitNami one-click installers](http://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab) Get an image with GitLab and GitLab CI preinstalled for Amazon Web Services, Azure, VMware or your local server.

    bundle exec foreman start -p 3000

or start each component separately

    bundle exec rails s
    script/background_jobs start

### Run the tests
